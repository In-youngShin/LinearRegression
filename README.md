This tutorial is designed to assist beginners who are learning predictive modeling. 
It covers the process of building a predictive model using linear regression based on gradient descent learning.

Example Context:

The Reddit post discussing James Harden's performance in NBA games: Reddit Post Link.
James Harden, a prominent NBA player, has garnered attention for his alleged affinity for strip clubs. Someone on Reddit became curious about whether Harden's off-court preferences impacted his game. This individual collected data on the average ratings of strip clubs and James Harden's performance scores in various cities. Surprisingly, a correlation emerged between these two variables (refer to the provided link for more details).
The reddit analysis only suggested a correlation, so the causality remains uncertain. 
However, given the findings from the Reddit post, can we develop a predictive model to forecast James Harden's performance? What algorithms could we utilize for model development? 
Additionally, can we trust the reliability of this model, or are there potentially overlooked factors influencing the outcomes?

This tutorial aims to address these questions by employing linear regression based on gradient descent learning.
